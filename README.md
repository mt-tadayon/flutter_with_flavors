# flutter_with_flavors

In this project I create 2 flavors for the default counter flutter project. Each flavor has different icons and custom configuration.\
In the origin/master branch, you can find the complete project with solution.\
In tutorial-with-todos branch, you can follow the todos and create two flavors from the single code base step by step.
